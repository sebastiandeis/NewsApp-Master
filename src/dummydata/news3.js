			'Zhou Duo helped evacuate Tiananmen Square in 1989. These days he defends the movement, but sees democracy in retreat in the West and far off in China.\nBEIJING — As daybreak neared on June 4, 1989, Zhou Duo walked toward the ranks of soldiers bristling with guns. Behind him, thousands of protesters huddled on Tiananmen Square, terrified that the encroaching troops would slaughter them on China’s most hallowed political ground.\nThe soldiers had already shot wildly at incensed crowds when they stormed into Beijing that night under orders to clear the square by morning, and Mr. Zhou hoped to negotiate a path out for the demonstrators, many of them students. Mr. Zhou swallowed his fear and told a People’s Liberation Army officer: “Enough blood has flowed; there must not be any more.”\nMr. Zhou was one of four young intellectuals who helped save lives by negotiating the evacuation of protesters from the square. Thirty years later, Mr. Zhou, 72, is among the few prominent actors from the protests who remain in China and continue to defend the hopes of the 1989 movement, even while agonizing over its lessons.\nMr. Zhou often ponders the choices he made that culminated in the escape from Tiananmen Square. His life, closely watched by the state security officers, has become a difficult vigil for the democratic ideals that electrified the protests 30 years ago, he said.\nStifling censorship has enforced a silence over those who try to keep alive the memory of the protests and massacre, and has scrubbed the internet in China of virtually any references to the upheavals. The country has become increasingly authoritarian under Xi Jinping, the leader of the ruling Communist Party, whose administration has rounded up rights lawyers, labor activists, students and Muslim ethnic minorities.\n“I’ve felt increasingly isolated,” Mr. Zhou said in an interview in Beijing ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. “Not many people care about June 4; young people don’t even know about it.” He was speaking in a cafe in north Beijing where other customers, eyes often fixed on their phones, seemed a world away from the talk of demonstrations and bloodshed.\nMr. Zhou’s daily reality is a stark reminder of how successfully China’s ruling Communist Party has married economic growth with authoritarian rule over the past three decades, resoundingly rejecting calls for greater political freedom.\nBut even more unexpected to Mr. Zhou were the troubles in Western countries that he admired as models of liberal democracy. The political divisions under President Trump and Britain’s Brexit shambles showed that even mature democracies could fall prey to dangerous populism and demagogy, Mr. Zhou said.\n“Taking it all in, you don’t see any bright spots,” he said.\nIn 1989, Mr. Zhou was part of the “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” a nickname for the group who went on a hunger strike during the demonstrations and later helped evacuate the square.\nThe others included Liu Xiaobo, the dissident who later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while in prison for his democratic activism. Mr. Liu died a prisoner in 2017. Another, Gao Xin, left for the United States, while the fourth, Hou Dejian, a musician born in Taiwan, has retreated from dissent.\nMr. Zhou spent nearly a year in detention after the 1989 crackdown, but even after his release, he is closely watched. “Now I wonder if I’ll have to live in this big prison indefinitely,” Mr. Zhou said before the security police spirited him away for the anniversary.\nIn recent weeks, the police have taken away or put under house arrest dozens of dissidents and political activists, according to human rights groups. Among them are the organizers of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of family members of people killed or maimed in the crackdown, which issued 23 video statements from relatives who urged the Chinese government to seek forgiveness for the killings.\n“Thirty years have passed, and I feel that this brutal atrocity that took place under the gaze of the entire world should have been addressed long ago,” Zhang Xianling, whose teenage son, Wang Nan, was shot dead near Tiananmen Square, said in one of the videos. “This was a crime of the state.”\nThe Tiananmen protests erupted in April 1989, when students gathered to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang, a reform-minded Communist Party leader. Their commemorations grew into a six-week-long movement, with hundreds of thousands pouring onto the square to demand greater political freedoms and an end to corruption.\nMr. Zhou knew how brutal China’s politics could be. His family suffered persecution under Mao. But he also had a lot at stake in China’s future. He had worked with a famed sociologist at Peking University and then moved to a management job with an innovative Beijing electronics firm.\nMr. Zhou served as an intermediary between protest leaders and moderate party officials trying to coax the students to leave the square. He formed an unlikely bond with Mr. Liu, the future Nobel Prize winner, who back then was a combative literary academic and an ardent supporter of the students. Mr. Zhou was less sure.\n“From start to finish, I felt conflicted, unsure about the right thing to do,” Mr. Zhou said of the protests.\nThen, on the night of June 3, the People’s Liberation Army swarmed into the city, and word of mass carnage reached Tiananmen Square. Time was pressing; the troops had orders to reclaim the square in hours. Mr. Zhou and his three friends tried to organize the remaining protesters to leave, but getting out was dangerous, and some wanted to stay and fight.\nMr. Zhou and Mr. Hou, the musician, approached the soldiers to negotiate. Mr. Zhou begged for time and a passage to allow the protesters to leave safely. An officer agreed. Near dawn, thousands of students and residents filed off the square, some in tears, some singing or shouting defiant slogans.\n“A river of blood was about to flow on the square,” Mr. Zhou wrote in his memoir. “If this wasn’t a miracle, what was?”After his year in detention following the crackdown, he tried his hand at philanthropy, but the authorities made it impossible for him to keep running a charity to support poor rural teachers.\nOver the past three decades, Mr. Zhou has traveled abroad, including as a visiting scholar at Harvard. But the police restrictions he faced in China cut off the chances of a new career in business or teaching. Occasionally, he would weigh in on discussions about the lessons of Tiananmen.\nNow in retirement, Mr. Zhou lives off a pension, dividing his time between Beijing and a home in southern China, writing essays about his past and on current affairs, and giving classes in classical music, one of his lifelong loves. This week, his memoirs were published in Hong Kong, beyond the reach of Chinese censors.\nWith age, he has become more cautious about the pathway for democracy in China.\nChina’s middle class has grown and many wealthier people travel abroad, but that has not brought the tilt against party control that many liberals hoped for. China’s business and intellectual elites were too compromised to challenge the party, Mr. Zhou said.\n“There are no domestic forces that can keep in check the Communist Party,” he said. “Its powers of control and repression, and now with the internet, high-tech, big data, artificial intelligence, facial recognition — well, the future looks more like 1984.”\nMr. Zhou thinks China should pursue gradual political change leading to legal limits on power and greater political diversity. When citizens are better off and politically mature, the country will be ready to evolve into a liberal democracy, he said.\n“Even if a revolution overthrows the Chinese Communist Party and establishes a liberal democratic order, could it work?” he said. “It will certainly be a tortuous, slow and difficult process.”\n',

However, such an agreement could still take years to materialize and would face many hurdles.\n',

According to The Globe, the federal and Alberta governments are working with companies on new regulations to authorize the discharge of treated effluent.\nThis follows on recent revelations from a leaked Alberta Energy Regulator presentation that in a “worst-case scenario” total liabilities for oil and gas operations could be as much as $260-billion. Taxpayers have purchased a used pipeline from Kinder Morgan for $4.5-billion so the industry can ship its product to unspecified markets, which we are assured will be profitable.

Are there no limits to the concessions that we must make to facilitate this ill-conceived industry?\nIn the 1960s when oil (then called tar) sands were in their infancy, regulators approved the use of tailings ponds to dispose of fluid fine tailings (FFT), swallowing the industry assurances that pollutants would quickly settle and Mother Nature would neutralize any toxins. Unfortunately, the assurances were wrong, so bigger tailings ponds became necessary. The industry was allowed to expand without solving the FFT dilemma, so soon the toxic ponds resembled a moderate-size lake district in extent. Simply put, pollutants did not disappear because they were associated with tiny clay particles that required hundreds of years to settle, and some contaminants were too toxic to be decomposed by normal biological processes.\nIn 2008, public outrage over the burgeoning tailings ponds caused the Alberta government to pass Directive 074, designed to eliminate the discharge of FFT. Unfortunately, compliance proved too difficult for the industry. After grandfathering release of FFT for several years, regulators in 2015 replaced 074 with Directive 085, which once again allows the release of FFT into toxic ponds.\nSeveral new mines were approved under the promise that FFT could be covered with fresh water and turned into delightful productive lakes. Environmental review panels approved more than 30 such “end pit lakes,” despite the fact that only one large-scale experiment was undertaken to test the end-pit-to-recreational-lake fantasy. After seven years, results have shown little promise. In 2018, the bad news started to leak out, that after a half-century of operation, oil-sands companies and regulators still don’t seem to know how to deal with FFT.\nMeanwhile, more than one trillion litres of FFT have been allowed to accumulate in tailings ponds, some of near great-lake magnitude.\nThe latest desperate proposal would allow toxic tailings to be slowly discharged into the Athabasca River, using the age-old industry trick that “dilution is the solution to pollution.” But the river downstream of the oil sands is already polluted enough to cause some concerns.\nA wide variety of toxic metals and organic compounds are already being released to the river and the air, confirmed by an upgraded monitoring program run co-operatively by provincial and federal agencies. Fish and the eggs of fish-eating birds contain mercury high enough to require consumption restrictions for humans who rely on them for food. Exposure of fish embryos to even low levels of bitumen in water causes increased mortality and a high rate of malformations in surviving embryos. Detectable concentrations of organic compounds, some toxic or carcinogenic, are found in water and sediments. Both traditional knowledge and scientific studies have shown that the high rates of malformations persist into adult fish, with incidences similar to those found near Superfund sites (areas in the United States that require long-term cleanup because of the most hazardous pollution).\nThese were among the findings that prompted UNESCO to consider downgrading the status of Wood Buffalo National Park at the mouths of the Athabasca and Slave Rivers from “heritage” status to the list of “world heritage in danger.”\nIndigenous people downstream of the oil sands have largely ceased eating fish or drinking water from the Athabasca River.

			"My guess is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has seen this freight train coming at her for a long time — probably about the time President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, precipitating the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel.\nThe chugging engine is impeachment, and the shrewd speaker is tied to the tracks destined for an inevitable fate she wants to avoid: impeachment hearings.\nFrom 2017 through the 2018 elections, Democrats howled with moral outrage about the lack of oversight — and at times outright accommodation — by the Republican House majority when it came to Trump, Russian interference in the 2016 election and the possible obstruction of the special counsel’s investigation.\nNow it’s 2019. Pelosi is speaker, the gavels of the key House committees are controlled by chairsloyal to her, and Mueller’s report is complete. And the upshot of that report is crystal clear. Trump committed impeachable offenses. The subtextof Mueller’s public comments last week were just as clear: “Hey Congress, read my report and, per the Constitution, the ball is in your court.”\nRead more commentary:\n6 ways Democrats can ease America into thinking about impeachment and Trump\nDemocrats need to get past impeachment jitters. It's not 1998 and Trump is no Clinton.\nDonald Trump really is 'crying out' for impeachment. It's the ultimate victim card.\nNow Pelosi is leading a party that can do the right thing after years of mocking spineless GOP Trump appeasers. And just as those GOP appeasers have maintained that anything less than being Trump toadies was bad politics for Republicans, Pelosi is insisting that impeachment is bad politics for Democrats. Behind closed doors, she calls impeachment a “fool’s errand,” Axios reported, citing an unnamed close Pelosi ally.\nThis conventional wisdom is now Beltway dogma, with pundits repeating it daily, churning it into a cyclone of spin. It grows from the belief that President Bill Clinton's impeachment debate was bad for the prosecuting party (Republicans) in the 1998 election so it would be bad for the Democrats in 2020. Additionally, Trump appears to want the impeachment fight because he only knows how to succeed if he’s in a fight.\nThen there’s the more cynical reality. What’s the point of impeaching Trump if the Republican-heavy Senate will surely acquit him? Or, even more cynically, what if Trump is removed from office and the Democrats lose their primary fundraising and voter turnout foil for 2020? Let’s face it, Trump has been worth tens of millions of dollars to the Democrats.\nSo here’s Pelosi: fighting the gravitational pull of evidence, duty, moral obligation and honesty while knowing that as a political leader, she must continue to resist that pull — and instead take the awful path that is most politically expedient for the good of her party and its agenda. That’s right. She’s becoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And she must hate it.\nWe’re at the moment in the Trump saga where the cable talking heads, columnists, Democrats and late-night comedians who have savaged McConnell and other Republicans for refusing to torch Trump for his obvious flaws and malfeasance either need to similarly torch Pelosi or start apologizing to McConnell & Co. If Pelosi is showing courage for doing the right thing politically for her party, then McConnell is also courageous. If McConnell is reprehensible for not moving against an impeachable president, then Pelosi is also reprehensible. You can’t have it both ways and have any intellectual or moral integrity.\nBack to Pelosi tied to those tracks with the impeachment engine bearing down on her. She’s going to have to soon acknowledge the engine isn’t slowing down, and she’ll have to get off the tracks because there’s no stopping it. An impeachment inquiry will have to eventually commence. House Democrats may call it something else (the Watergate hearings did not begin as “impeachment hearings;” those came a year later), but there is an obvious burden upon them to put witnesses under oath in public hearings. And surely that will result in captivating moments through the fall.\nPelosi and her leadership are probably now plotting a timeline that slowly plays out the process so that popular opinion to just let the election happen will grow into a mandate against passing articles of impeachment. With some good fortune, Democratic front-runners will still be polling ahead of Trump in the fall and can unite in a call to let the voters replace Trump.\nThe other fact of her fate that must irritate House speaker is that even if she gets high marks from the news media for outwitting the president in skirmishes, like the recent “Infrastructure Week” White House meeting that Trump stalked out of, the larger arc of politics is being bent by Trump. Like all things in the Trump era, the conventional political laws of gravity are suspended. His wanton misbehavior ironically puts her on constant defense. He is truly the ultimate disrupter.\nDon’t expect the general hypocrisy of loathing McConnell the appeaser and extolling Pelosi the tactician to subside in the months ahead, but it is indeed a hypocrisy.\nRob Stutzman, founder and president of Stutzman Public Affairs in Sacramento, was chief of staff for communications to former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Follow him on Twitter: @robstutzman\n",

And just as those GOP appeasers have maintained that anything less than being Trump toadies was bad politics for Republicans, Pelosi is insisting that impeachment is bad politics for Democrats. Behind closed doors, she calls impeachment a “<a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://www.axios.com/nancy-pelosi-rejects-donald-trump-impeachment-fa067c6c-a04d-40d6-8825-c159969c51af.html" target="_blank">fool’s errand</a>,” Axios reported, citing an unnamed close Pelosi ally.</p>\n<p class="p-text">This conventional wisdom is now Beltway dogma, with pundits repeating it daily, churning it into a cyclone of spin. It grows from the belief that President Bill Clinton\'s impeachment debate was <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/politics/2018/12/18/20-years-after-clinton-impeachment-lessons-loom-trump-congress-russia/2287529002/" target="_blank">bad for the prosecuting party</a> (Republicans) in the 1998 election so it would be bad for the Democrats in 2020.

Or, even more cynically, what if Trump is removed from office and the Democrats lose their primary fundraising and voter turnout foil for 2020? Let’s face it, Trump has been worth <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html" target="_blank">tens of millions of dollars</a> to the Democrats.  </p>\n<p class="p-text">So here’s Pelosi: fighting the gravitational pull of evidence, duty, moral obligation and honesty while knowing that as a political leader, she must continue to resist that pull — and instead take the awful path that is most politically expedient for the good of her party and its agenda. That’s right. She’s becoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And she must hate it.</p>\n<p class="p-text">We’re at the moment in the Trump saga where the cable talking heads, columnists, Democrats and late-night comedians who have savaged McConnell and other Republicans for refusing to torch Trump for his obvious flaws and malfeasance either need to similarly torch Pelosi or start apologizing to McConnell &amp; Co. If Pelosi is showing courage for doing the right thing politically for her party, then McConnell is also courageous. If McConnell is reprehensible for not moving against an impeachable president, then Pelosi is also reprehensible. You can’t have it both ways and have any intellectual or moral integrity.  </p>\n<p class="p-text">Back to Pelosi tied to those tracks with the impeachment engine bearing down on her. She’s going to have to soon acknowledge the engine isn’t slowing down, and she’ll have to get off the tracks because there’s no stopping it. An impeachment inquiry will have to eventually commence. House Democrats may call it something else (the <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Feature_Homepage_WatergateHearingBegins.htm" target="_blank">Watergate hearings</a> did not begin as “impeachment hearings;” those came <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-begins-impeachment-of-nixon" target="_blank">a year later</a>), but there is an obvious burden upon them to put witnesses under oath in public hearings. And surely that will result in captivating moments through the fall.</p>\n<p class="p-text">Pelosi and her leadership are probably now plotting a timeline that slowly plays out the process so that popular opinion to just let the election happen will grow into a mandate against passing articles of impeachment. With some good fortune,<a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/politics/elections/2019/05/29/robert-mueller-statement-sparks-impeachment-calls-2020-democrats/1270619001/" target="_blank"> Democratic front-runners</a> will still be polling ahead of Trump in the fall and can unite in a call to let the voters replace Trump.</p>\n<p class="p-text">The other fact of her fate that must irritate House speaker is that even if she gets high marks from the news media for <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1131660259959955457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131660259959955457&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F05%2F23%2Fpelosi-trump-escalating-war-words-democrats-white-house%2F1207030001%2F" target="_blank">outwitting </a>the president in skirmishes, like the recent “Infrastructure Week” White House meeting that Trump <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/politics/2019/05/23/donald-trumps-blowup-nancy-pelosi-imperils-white-house-agenda/3755374002/" target="_blank">stalked out of</a>, the larger arc of politics is being bent by Trump.

			"Il s'agit du projet d'interdiction des plastiques à usage unique annoncé lundi par le premier ministre Justin Trudeau.L'annonce est aussi attendue que bienvenue. Chaque année, les Canadiens jettent plus de 3 millions de tonnes de plastique à la poubelle. Moins de 10 % des déchets de plastique sont recyclés et une infime quantité de plastique est utilisée comme source d'énergie dans des projets qui restent pour l'instant expérimentaux.Dans l'état actuel des choses, il est plus facile de produire du plastique neuf, quitte à le jeter dès qu'il a servi, que de le recycler ou le réparer, affirme une analyse des sociétés Deloitte et Services Cheminfo.En d'autres mots, si l'on suit les lois du marché, les assiettes, ustensiles et barquettes de plastique, les tasses en styromousse, les sacs d'épicerie et autres emballages plastifiés destinés à être jetés après usage ont toutes les chances de continuer à prendre le plus court chemin vers le dépotoir.Avec l'annonce de lundi, le Canada suivrait l'exemple européen sur un autre point, en renvoyant aux entreprises productrices la responsabilité de gérer leurs déchets de plastique.Il n'est pas trop tôt pour s'attaquer au cancer écologique causé par les déchets de plastique, dont la vaste majorité provient de ces petits objets non réutilisables omniprésents dans la vie courante.

			"This is the proposed ban on single-use plastics announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. The announcement is as expected as welcome. Every year, Canadians throw more than 3 million tonnes of plastic in the garbage bin. Less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled and a tiny amount of plastic is used as a source of energy in projects that are still experimental at the moment. As things stand, it is easier to produce new plastic, even if it is disposed of as soon as it is used, than to recycle or repair it, says an analysis of the Companies Deloitte and Cheminfo.In other words, if we follow the laws of the market, plastic plates, utensils and trays, styrofoam cups, grocery bags and other plasticized packaging intended to be disposed of after use have every chance of continuing to take the shortest path to the dump. It is not too early to tackle ecological cancer caused by plastic waste, the vast majority of which comes from these small, non-reusable objects ubiquitous in everyday life. If nothing is done, the oceans could contain more plastic than fish by 2050! It's not that far away. It's 30 years from now. Let's start by applauding the Prime Minister's announcement. The main flat, because there is one, is that she arrives at this late moment of her first term. For now, the plan remains very blurred. Its details, including the list of items that will be banned and the manner in which they will be banned, remain unknown. Not only is Canada lagging behind the European Union, whose initiative is infinitely more concrete, but in view of the time it will take to refine the strategy for the war on plastic, the risk that the project will not succeed by the fall election is very high. Depending on the outcome of the vote - and the latest polls show that nothing is taken for Justin Trudeau's Liberals - the beautiful plan to dispose of single-use plastics is likely to end up in water. One wonders why Justin Trudeau waited so long before launching his anti-plastic offensive. And if he does not use this project to “re-image” his image on the eve of this election rate.But even among environmentalists, it is recognized that the post-plastic transition will not be easy. The environmentalist who plans to run for the PLC, Steven Guilbeault, gives an example of the various food fairs where the use of plastic dishes is widespread. What are we going to replace her with? The use of ceramic plates is not always realistic. We are thinking of the oil residues to market, but also of the companies that will have to pay more to provide consumers with disposable plastic substitutes. That said, if the European Union is ready to take the leap, there is no reason why Canada should not be too. And until the federal project is clarified, there is nothing to prevent Quebec from starting its own anti-plastic turn. As Ontario has done, which is considering not only a ban on single-use plastics in its territory, but also a system for the deposit of plastic bottles.",

			"This was evidenced by the announcement last week of the addition of 850 professionals and teachers to the school system. This will be achieved by the injection of some $70 million, which is foreseen under the most recent budget. The Minister's primary concern seems to be the success of the students, but also the fate of all the players in the network. This former teacher knows very well how well the two go together. What strikes, too, at Jean-François Roberge, is overwhelming optimism. “Keep hope, the cavalry is coming,” he said last Tuesday when he gave the green light to the recruitment of 850 professionals and teachers. General Roberge's strategy is the right one. Recruiting hundreds of professionals - speech therapists, psychologists, psychoeducators, etc. - is undoubtedly a step forward for the network. The existence of a teacher-pupil ratio, which must be respected in the education network, protects teachers from job cuts. Professionals could be sacrificed more easily because they did not have such protection.What is likely to make a difference this time is that we are talking about a real bonus. As a result of the austerity measures, under the Liberals, 375 professional positions had been abolished. We have just completed the catch-up and returned to the level before the cutbacks. We are talking about the network as a whole. Some school boards have made significant efforts, but others have unfortunately not yet hired enough professionals to fill the eliminated positions.

Much is being said to enhance the teaching profession - which needs it - especially by improving their salary conditions. Why not conduct a similar reflection about professionals?

The Fédération des professionnels et professionnels de l'éducation du Québec estimates that at the very least 2000 more would be needed to meet all needs.

			" The US Department of Defense released its Indo-Pacific Strategy Report over the weekend. Now that the theoretical framework of the strategy is complete, there remain uncertainties about how the rhetoric will translate into reality. US, Japan, Australia and India are the pillars of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. But currently, the role of the key player - India - is missing. The Australian Defense Force is relatively small with about 60,000 full-time active-duty personnel. As for Japan, it hosts 23 US military bases. The active and reserve personnel of Japan's Self-Defense Forces stand at 300,000, most of who are deployed in Northeast Asia and can hardly focus on the mission of containing China. Therefore, the US must woo India to join its strategic canvas.\nAt the Shangri-La Dialogue, US Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan boasted of US strength by saying that it has more than 370,000 service members in the Indo-Pacific region and the US Pacific Command has four times more assigned forces than any other geographic combatant command. However, even with a fairly large deployment, the US has so far failed to form a Cold War-like quasi-alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.\nThis is where we see room for the improvement of China-India relations. During the Doklam border standoff in 2017, China's leadership exercised restraint and eventually the crisis ended peacefully. Bilateral relations, which had almost gone to the edge of the cliff, are back to normal. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was absent from this year's Shangri-La Dialogue. His keynote speech at last year's gathering disappointed Americans. Modi had said that India does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a club of limited members or directed against any country.\nOn the one hand, as an independent state that sticks to non-alignment, India is poised to show an upright posture. On the other, the Indo-Pacific Command does not suit India's interest.\nIndia has the desire to dominate the Indian Ocean. The biggest obstacle to this ambition is the US, not China. While the US wants to inject its influence into the Indian Ocean and New Delhi aims to play a dominant role in the region, there are bound to be strains. When former US defense secretary Leon Panetta visited India in 2012, he urged closer military relations with the US, while Indian leaders stayed cool to aligning strategically with Washington. Although the Pentagon chiefs keep changing, the essence of the US' Indo-Pacific strategy has not changed. While the US wants to use India to keep China in check, it is wary of New Delhi's ambition in the Indian Ocean. The Indo-Pacific Command ranges from the US' West Coast all the way to the west coast of India.

Now that the theoretical framework of the strategy is complete, there remain uncertainties about how the rhetoric will translate into reality. <br/><br/>US, Japan, Australia and India are the pillars of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. But currently, the role of the key player - India - is missing. The Australian Defense Force is relatively small with about 60,000 full-time active-duty personnel. As for Japan, it hosts 23 US military bases. The active and reserve personnel of Japan\'s Self-Defense Forces stand at 300,000, most of who are deployed in Northeast Asia and can hardly focus on the mission of containing China. Therefore, the US must woo India to join its strategic canvas.<br/><br/>At the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/987072.shtml" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue</a>, US Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan boasted of US strength by saying that it has more than 370,000 service members in the Indo-Pacific region and the US Pacific Command has four times more assigned forces than any other geographic combatant command. <br/><br/>However, even with a fairly large deployment, the US has so far failed to form a Cold War-like quasi-alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.<br/><br/>This is where we see room for the improvement of China-India relations. During the Doklam border standoff in 2017, China\'s leadership exercised restraint and eventually the crisis ended peacefully. Bilateral relations, which had almost gone to the edge of the cliff, are back to normal. <br/><br/>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was absent from this year\'s Shangri-La Dialogue. His keynote speech at last year\'s gathering disappointed Americans. <br/><br/>Modi had said that India does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a club of limited members or directed against any country.<br/><br/>On the one hand, as an independent state that sticks to non-alignment, India is poised to show an upright posture. On the other, the Indo-Pacific Command does not suit India\'s interest.<br/><br/>India has the desire to dominate the Indian Ocean. The biggest obstacle to this ambition is the US, not China. While the US wants to inject its influence into the Indian Ocean and New Delhi aims to play a dominant role in the region, there are bound to be strains. <br/><br/>When former US defense secretary Leon Panetta visited India in 2012, he urged closer military relations with the US, while Indian leaders stayed cool to aligning strategically with Washington. Although the Pentagon chiefs keep changing, the essence of the US\' Indo-Pacific strategy has not changed. <br/><br/>While the US wants to use India to keep China in check, it is wary of New Delhi\'s ambition in the Indian Ocean. The Indo-Pacific Command ranges from the US\' West Coast all the way to the west coast of India. India will not give in to the US move of stepping into its sphere of influence.<br/><br/>And this is the core of US\' Indo-Pacific strategy. Despite the rhetoric, implementing it is difficult. The US wants to dominate the world by aiming high, nonetheless it lacks the power to do so.<br/><br/>Shanahan said during the Shangri-La Dialogue that no one nation can, or should, dominate the Indo-Pacific, which implicitly pointed to China, but this applies to the US itself. <br/><br/><em>The article was compiled by Global Times reporter Li Aixin based on an interview with Jin Yinan, professor from the PLA\'s National Defense University, during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last week. liaixin@globaltimes.com.cn<br/><br/></em><br/><br/><br/>\n<div class="pull-left"><div class="row-title"><strong>RELATED ARTICLES:</strong> </div><div class="row-content"><ul class="unstyled"><li><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1153095.shtml"> US-India trade war is more myth than reality</a></li><li><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1153070.shtml"> India intensifies search operations for missing Air Force aircraft</a></li><li><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1153054.shtml"> India to begin "5G" trials in 100 days</a></li></ul></div></div> </div>',

			'On April 18, the government announced that the Chief Executive and the Executive Council had approved the exemption of waiver fees, rent and associated costs for land granted for transitional housing purposes as a measure to mitigate the hardship suffered by families living in inferior accommodation.\nAccording to the legislature’s documents, there are approximately 1,600 units of transitional housing in Hong Kong, including the Trackside Villas owned by MTR Corporation, which will provide 252 units upon completion of renovation, scheduled for 2020.\nThe latest figure from the Housing Department indicates that the average waiting time for public housing has climbed to 5.5 years – the highest since 1997. The government’s “Long Term Housing Strategy Annual Progress Report 2018” announced an adjustment to the ratio of public to private housing, from 6:4 to 7:3.\nThis will result in a fall in the yearly supply of private housing units from 18,000 to 13,500. The report projected that there will only be 14,500 public housing units per year in the coming five years, and the average waiting time for public housing will be extended to six years.\nThe statistics show that the future public housing supply in Hong Kong will be inadequate, leading to longer and longer waiting times for families in need. In view of this, the government is going to further promote the Transitional Housing Scheme and provide underprivileged families with a liveable place while waiting for public housing.\nThe task force on transitional housing, under the Transport and Housing Bureau, has received a proposal for transitional housing from Yan Chai Hospital. Yan Chai proposes to build 110 to 130 “pipe homes” – micro-apartments inside giant concrete drainage pipes – on a land plot measuring 3,300 square metres in Tsuen Wan. With each home accommodating up to four people, the square box-shaped units and round pipe homes can provide shelter for approximately 250 to 350 people.\nThe target groups will be individuals and families who have been waiting for public housing for more than three years, or others who currently live in inferior housing.\nThe concept of pipe homes originates from Europe. However, it is of paramount importance to first understand the differences between Hong Kong and European countries in terms of their living environment. In Europe, transitional housing premises are rented on a short-term basis to residents with low incomes but high mobility.\nKeetwonen in Amsterdam and Ladywell Prop-up Village in London are good examples. These modular houses are usually around 300 square feet in size with monthly rents ranging from HK$2,000 to HK$10,000 (US$255 to US$1,276). The widespread popularity of transitional housing in Europe is mainly due to their abundance of land, a culture of renting premises as homes and remarkably comprehensive rental assistance schemes.\nIn Hong Kong, however, pipe homes can only be installed under flyovers, in vacant car parks, industrial areas or even remote parks. Apart from potential light, air and noise pollution problems, community facilities are also insufficient. Is it really appropriate to copy the entire European concept of transitional housing to Hong Kong? I doubt it.\nWith the government’s full understanding of the recommendations of the task force on land supply, I concurred that the government should give priority to granting sites to the housing authority for the development of public rental housing or subsidised flats with resale restrictions to ease the prevailing housing shortage.\nMore importantly, vacant school campuses and industrial buildings close to residential areas can be re-zoned for development of subsidised-sales flats for low-income families. Restrictions should be imposed to limit the resale of the premises, which can only be sold to buyers of the same eligibility. We proposed that resale should be permitted only to eligible grass-roots families and renting out not allowed.\nIn this way, we can expedite the turnover of subsidised-sales flats in Hong Kong. When the economic conditions of families living in subsidised flats improve, they can consider buying flats in the private residential market.\nWith regard to the problem of ageing buildings in some urban districts, namely To Kwa Wan, Yau Ma Tei, Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan, we should not underestimate the effect of accumulating small pieces of land in relieving the housing issue. I recommend the sustained construction of subsidised housing for Hong Kong residents who wish and are able to buy their own flats.\nIn fact, having a comfortable home and a good job is the aspiration of almost all Hongkongers. So why does the government consider only “transition” but not “home ownership”?\nMany Hongkongers have been working hard with a dream of home ownership. Although the government has been emphasising the shortage of land supply as the reason, the skyrocketing property prices of the past 10 years have broken the home ownership dream of many.\nThe previous generation has made their best endeavours to improve their living environment from wooden houses and resettlement areas. Nonetheless, while the government aims to improve the social mobility of the youth in Hong Kong, it is lamentable that the younger generation may have to live in temporary pipe homes for their settlement. There could be no bigger irony than if the rapid economic development was to drive a decline in living conditions in Hong Kong.\n',
