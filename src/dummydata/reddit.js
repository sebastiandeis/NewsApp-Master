		author: 'omarthaherfit',
		text:
			'[Before and After Picture (438 lbs to 260 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/KnSMQOW) \n\nSince a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. With the use of IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day), keeping CICO in mind, and a consistent workout routine, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.\n\n\nHeight: 6’2\n\nAge: 20 years old\n\nWeight Difference in Before and After Picture: 438 lbs to 260 lbs (178 lbs lost)\n\n\nExercise:\n\nI have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently. \n\nSince I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.\n\nHere is the current routine I am following:\n\nDay 1 (Upper Day):\nBench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nBarbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nDB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nWide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nDB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps\nStraight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps\n\nDay 2 (Lower Day):\nBack Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nDeadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nHack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nLying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nSingle-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nStanding Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\nCore Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\n\nDay 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.)\n\nDay 4 (Pull Day):\nBarbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nWide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nT-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nClose-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nStraight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each\nBarbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nHammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\n\nDay 5 (Push Day):\nDB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nOverhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nIncline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nCable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nLateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nClose-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nTricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\n\nDay 6 (Leg Day):\nBack Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nDeadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nLeg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nLeg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps\nSeated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\nCore Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\n\nDay 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)\n\n\nDiet:\n\nI believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet.\n\nMacros: \n\nCurrently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible.\n\nDay of eating:\n\nMost days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of.\n\nSupplements:\n\n-Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost)\n\n-Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually)\n\n-ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout) \n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)\n\n\nEDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. 🙏❤️',

I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the current routine I am following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 1 (Upper Day):\nBench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nBarbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nDB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nWide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nDB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps\nStraight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 2 (Lower Day):\nBack Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps\nDeadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nHack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps\nLying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nSingle-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nStanding Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\nCore Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 4 (Pull Day):\nBarbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nWide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nT-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nClose-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nStraight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each\nBarbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nHammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 5 (Push Day):\nDB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nOverhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nIncline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nCable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nLateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nClose-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps\nTricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 6 (Leg Day):\nBack Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps\nDeadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nLeg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps\nLeg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps\nSeated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps\nCore Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Macros: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day of eating:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supplements:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

					"Honestly, there's no ideal solution for you in this situation. \n\nThere's no gym that's *everywhere* - as you seem to have learned for yourself. \n\nDo you have any 'base' which you'd call home / spend the most time in... or are you legit living out of a suitcase 365 days a year? \n\nMany gyms where I live do 'Rolling memberships' of much shorter periods of 1-3 months. Can still save you money over pay-per-use. \n\nMany of the gyms where I live - especially public or 'muni' gyms - do 'bulk passes'. For example, instead of paying €5 per use, you can buy a 10-use pass for €35 or whatever. Would save you a little money, and also give you extra motivation to go to the gym to get your moneys worth. \n\nThis works both if you're gonna be somewhere for a few weeks, and also if you're gonna be in a town for a couple days, a few times a year (the latter will definitely add some admin overhead though). \n\n\nBeyond that, there's the 'be more flexible' approach. \n\nMany of my friends who travel - though it sounds like less than you - use 'tiered plans' when they're away. \n\nBasically, they pick a workout they'll do when they're home, then have 'fallback' plans for when they can't get to the gym.

					"The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n&gt; Night owls can 'retrain' their body clocks to improve mental well-being and performance\n\n    \n&gt; A simple tweak to the sleeping patterns of 'night owls' - people with extreme late sleeping and waking habits - could lead to significant improvements in sleep/wake timings, improved performance in the mornings, better eating habits and a decrease in depression and stress.\n\n\n&gt; New international research by the Universities of Birmingham and Surrey in the UK, and Monash University in Australia, showed that, over a three-week period, it was possible to shift the circadian rhythm of 'night owls' using non-pharmacological and practical interventions.\n\n  \nJournal Reference:\n\nElise R. Facer-Childs, Benita Middleton, Debra J. Skene, Andrew P. Bagshaw,\n\nResetting the late timing of ‘night owls’ has a positive impact on mental health and performance,\n\nSleep Medicine, 2019, ISSN 1389-9457,\n\nLink: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945719301388\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2019.05.001.\n\nHighlights\n\nHere we took a group of ‘night owls’ (i.e. people with extreme late sleeping and waking patterns) and attempted to shift their habitual late timings earlier in a real-world setting using simple, practical non-pharmacological interventions. We show that by using this intervention we can:\n\n• Achieve a phase advance of around two hours\n\n• Decrease self-reported ratings of depression and stress\n\n• Reduce sleepiness in the morning\n\n• Significantly improve simple indices of cognitive and physical performance\n\nAbstract: \n\nThere is conflict between living according to our endogenous biological rhythms and our external environment, with disruptions resulting in negative consequences to health and performance. This is often documented in shift work and jet lag, but ‘societal norms’ e.g. typical working hours, can create profound issues for ‘night owls’, people whose internal biological timing predisposes them to follow an unusually late sleep-wake cycle. Night owls have also been associated with health issues, mood disturbances, poorer performance and increased mortality rates. This study used a randomized control trial design aimed to shift the late timing of night owls to an earlier time (phase advance), using non-pharmacological, practical interventions in a real-world setting. These interventions targeted light exposure (through earlier wake up/sleep times), fixed meals times, caffeine intake and exercise. Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by actigraphy and circadian phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no adverse effect on sleep duration. Importantly, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical ‘suboptimal’ morning hours. Our findings propose a novel strategy for shifting clock timing towards a pattern that is more aligned to societal demands that could significantly improve elements of performance, mental health and sleep timing in the real world.",

But we did send a manhole cover straight up at 60 km a second with a nuclear explosion...\n\nWe think it vaporized on the way up like a meteor in reverse.\n\nIf it did survive its short trip through the atmosphere, then it would indeed have enough velocity to escape.\n\nEdit: y'all need to learn what escape velocity is.\n\n\nSo you know how as you pump more energy into an orbit, it gets flatter and flatter? it just keeps getting more and more elliptical with a higher and higher Apoapsis?

			"This was the third book in my amazing twelve book present package from my wife for my birthday - I can open one book each month over the year.  Here's my original post about it:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b3pb5o/the_best_birthday_present_ive_received_for_a_long/\n\n.. and here's my last post when I unwrapped this amazing book:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bo0hl1/book_3_of_my_amazing_12_book_one_per_month/\n\n\nKitchen Confidential – Anthony Bourdain\n\nSynopsis (blurb from the back cover):\n\n\"I've been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands.\" After twenty-five years of 'sex, drugs, bad behaviour and haute cuisine', chef and novelist Anthony Bourdain has decided to tell all. From his first oyster in the Gironde to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he first experiences the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain's tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable, as shocking as they are funny. This unforgettable book will change the way you view restaurants for ever.\n\nMost readers will not need this introduction to Kitchen Confidential – it has sold millions of copies and has been read by a lot of you.  For some reason I’d never read it before now though, but being gifted the book has rectified this error.\n**I absolutely loved this book!**  I was a fan of Anthony Bourdain although I’d never read any of his writing and a lot of his TV series passed me by too.  I’ve always appreciated his humanity and curiosity, and I’m glad to report that his personality shines from these pages.  I thought that it shares its style with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway but although many of the stories are from an aggressive and unreconstructed male environment, you can tell Bourdain is fully aware of this, and contextualises it well.  Kitchen Confidential must have created a hell of a stir when it came out, blowing the lid on the shady practices and chaotic shadows of the commercial culinary world in the late 20th century.  \n\nI need to mention Chapter 4 especially – titled “A Day In The Life”.  This chapter is restricted to one typical day working in a kitchen, and is actually one of the longest chapters in the book.  I have never read such an intense, non-stop assault on the senses in my life, and it is worth reading the book for this chapter alone!\n\nI was left wanting to travel more, to experience life more fully, and to eat.  Eat stuff I would never normally eat, in the company of characters I wouldn’t usually speak to, and to trust in the generosity of others.  The loss of Anthony Bourdain has left the world a less colourful place.  I've already started \"A Cooks Tour\" to keep the Bourdain experience going..\n\nIf you’ve read the book, I would love to hear your comments as I have nobody else to talk to about it.  If you haven’t – what are you waiting for?!",

			"This is going to be a bit long-winded but the TL;DR is this question: What books have you read that feature characters with traits so strong and positive that you find yourself imitating them in your real life? \n\nRight now I'm reading Shogun by James Clavell for the second time. It's set during the year 1600, in Japan, and though the POV swivels to different characters, the main fella is named John Blackthorne (inspired by William Adams, the first Englishman to sail to the Japans). The extreme culture-shock he experiences is excellently articulated by Clavell, and his descriptions of Samurai and the Japanese way of life are beautiful (whether they're historically accurate or not I don't know, but that doesn't really matter to this post).  \n\nNow onto my point.  When I first read Shogun, two years ago, I noticed that my discipline in every day life was changing. More exercise, less junk food; more positive thoughts, less seeing the world as unfair to me; more calm, less worry. Clavell's portrayal of Samurai shows them as extremely disciplined people, devoted to a certain way of living that focused on honor, obedience, politeness, and harmony as pillars of a civilized society. Now, I'm not saying I ever felt inclined to commit ritualistic suicide whenever I messed up, but while the character of Blackthorne was adapting to his surroundings, slowly realizing that the English Protestant way of living had many flaws to it, and adopting the more civilized aspects of Japanese life into his own living, I too started to absorb many of the traits I found admirable about the Samurai and other Japanese (and also about Blackthorne himself).  On my second read of the book, the same thing started happening without me noticing - more exercise, more meditation, better diet etc. etc. I'm not saying the Japanese are perfect in the book, I'm just saying that their positive traits were so well written that they affected me in real life, and I really enjoy the feeling  \n\nAnother example would be the influence Atticus from To Kill A Mockingbird had on me. Ever since I read that book, Atticus pops into my mind whenever I notice myself judging anyone unfairly.  His total devotion to non-judgement and being an understanding person will probably be always stronger and more ingrained than mine, but the point is that I judge people a lot less now and am probably better off for it.  \n\nThe other big one is Kaladin from the Stormlight Archive book one, who's determination and tireless work ethic really made me dig my heels in whenever I felt like giving up on something.\n\nHave you ever experienced anything like this? Maybe a particular theme in a particular book changed your perspective and how you live. Or maybe you found a character so admirable you started mimicking them in real life?",

					"Well, basically no battle ever consisted of drawing swords and running at the other side in a loose mob and degenerating into a hundred one on one fights. That's what Hollywood shows because they have no idea what history was like an don't care. The other reason is historical warfare was a lot more boring and not visually appealing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost infantry warfare, everywhere, was fought in formation. Many men, in close formation, in ranks, usually with pole-arms of some kind. A spear is the most common weapon in history for that reason; gives you great reach and lets many men in different ranks all attack at once. It also keeps the cavalry at bay; a charging horse can plow through ranks of men, but a thicket of spears discourages this. So men in lines or blocks clashing across useful pieces of terrain. You want the high ground, you'd like to make your enemy charge up hill or across a river and kill them when they're disordered. The cohesion of a formation is the most important thing; the men have to trust each other and be drilled to move and act together. The presence of their comrades encourages them and shames them if they run away. Running away is death; not because cowards get executed but because a coward gets run down by the enemy and killed from behind because it's easy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInfantry will fight over the terrain that is most advantageous while the cavalry charges and harasses them. Samurai were great horse archers, so their favorite tactic was harassing the infantry from horseback. Ride up, fire a volley, fall back as the infantry pushes forward to drive them off, do it all again. Bleed and exhaust the infantry with arrow volleys, draw them out of position so they can be more easily destroyed. Foot archers, samurai or not, will also be firing volleys of arrows from behind the infantry, or behind earthworks or temporary barricades if possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cavalry is using their mobility to get behind and around the infantry line, to attack the archers and the flanks of the infantry formation. Most formation fighting is designed to deal with the enemy in front of you, so you don't want to be attacked from the flanks and rear (duh). When the cavalry thinks the infantry is weak or distracted, they will charge with sword and spear/lance. A cavalry charge is devastating; the most dangerous thing in the charge is the sheer mass and momentum of the horses running all out. They smash into men and knock them down and men are kicked and trampled in the scrum. Horses don't like stepping on people but warhorses are trained to kick and bite, and the rider will cut and thrust at the infantry who are all off balance and out of sorts from the charge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the infantry hold together, with good order and discipline, they can survive the charge and kill the cavalry once their momentum is played out. Once the charge is spent and the cavalry is amongst the infantry, unless the infantry has been put to rout and is fleeing, now the cavalry is surrounded by angry men who finally have them within their reach. Many samurai die, dragged down from their saddles and stabbed in the face by infantry. But the cavalry aren't helpless in the scrum; they are wheeling their horses around, slashing with swords and thrusting with spears, trying to keep the infantry at a distance and inflicting all the damage they can. They want to break off the engagement and fall back to regroup so they can go back to harassing with bows or charge again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so it goes, for however long courage and endurance can keep men on the field. The smallest things can make an army break; the rumor that their leader is dead, the banner falling. The rout is the worst. Most men killed in battle are killed when their side breaks and flees, and is chased down by the enemy. Cavalry does the majority of it, literally running men down, lancing them in the back, cutting them down from behind. Battle kills relative few soldiers; too difficult to score many fatal hits in chaos of combat. But a man running away is defenseless, his back is just a big target. The rout is a slaughter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf neither army routed, than they will most likely retire from the field, either when one general decides the battle can't be won and there's nothing left worth dying over, or night comes. Ideally, you will retreat in good order, your units covering each other and leap frogging back to whatever your local strong point is; a fortified camp or base, an actual stronghold or town. Then the wounded are tended to, the dead collected. Often there is a truce called for this; there's no strategic value in leaving the dead and wounded on the field. Then the generals plan what they're going to do tomorrow; fight again, retreat, move to a new position, negotiate.",

					"My grandmother was born in 1907. Her father was a Methodist circuit preacher in west Texas and Arkansas (obviously not at the same time).

Everything below is based on what she told me. \n\n(The moral of this is talk to old people.

					"There are a few good responses here, but also lots of speculation, and a heavy Western bias in how people are approaching the motivations for Zheng He's voyages.\n\n\nMuch of the information in this post can be found in the definitive book on Zheng He's voyages, When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405-1433, by Louise Levathes. Levathes approaches the topic like a historian and avoids the unnecessary archaeological speculation and \"what-ifs\" that have plagued recent historical accounts.\n\n\nI want to dissect this huge question in three parts: 1), the domestic political background; 2), the nature of Zheng He's voyages and their consequences, and 3), geopolitical implications of the end of the voyages.\n\n\nTo start, we must remember the context in which the Yongle Emperor gained control of China: he was never supposed to be emperor. Disliked by the scholar-bureaucrat class, Yongle enlisted the help of disempowered court eunuchs and military leaders to gain the throne. One of his biggest supporters was indeed Zheng He. As a result, it was only fair that the Yongle Emperor gave Zheng He the financial and political support necessary to begin the voyages, which served the dual purpose of solidifying China's dominance of Southeast Asia (and their claims to Vietnam) as well as the legitimacy of Yongle's rule.\n\n\nSecond, we must remind ourselves that Zheng He's voyages were nothing like those of de Gama, Columbus, Cabot, Magellan, or Cook. For the most part, Zheng He sailed a massive fleet on familiar routes that had been pioneered and mapped either by previous Chinese sailors or Arab sailors. Unlike Columbus, Zheng He was not interested in gold: China already dominated world trade through their silks, spices, and porcelain. \n\nIn fact, Zheng He's voyages were not just expensive in terms of funding the voyages, they also brought a net loss to the imperial treasury through gift-giving and tribute collecting. When Zheng He arrived in new lands like India, Ceylon, Indonesia, he brought expensive gifts. Although he expected tribute and fealty in return, his gifts often outweighed any financial gain that the voyages made. This was not because Zheng He was stupid, he was simply engaging in the standard diplomatic tradition of gift-giving that defined pre-modern Old World diplomacy. The goal of the voyages, again, was to promote China's regional dominance and restore the empire's tenuous claims to far-flung regions of Southeast Asia.\n\n\nLastly, we must re-examine why exactly the voyages ended. Contrary to popular belief, the voyages were not abruptly cancelled by the Xuande Emperor (aka Zhu Zhanji). Instead, the restoration of the Confucian-friendly Hongxi Emperor sparked the initial disinterest in the treasure fleet and its voyages. Hongxi had a variety of reasons for doing this: it was a wasteful use of money, it diverted troops to the relatively safe southern border and away for the precarious situation in the north, and it called into question Confucian dogma at the time, which insisted on the preeminence of China proper. For example, consider that Zheng He was reassigned the job of completing the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, a project that Confucian bureaucrats believed to be a far better use of money than show-boaty voyages. \n\nAfter the Hongxi Emperor died, the following Xuande Emperor, who was a friend of the Yongle Emperor, even granted Zheng He one last voyage before he died (a largely honorific gesture). Therefore, the end of the voyages was not so much a sudden end to a glorious age of Chinese expansionism, but a natural end to what many Confucian bureaucrats believed to be a wasteful experiment in ostentatious statecraft.\n\n\nI hope this helps!",

					"Hard to say what is the most crushing military defeat in history, as there's a lot of battles to choose from, and a lot of subjectivity into what constitutes 'crushing defeat'. That said, I'll put forward one such crushing defeat, the Battle of Cape Matapan, between the British Royal Navy and the Italian Regina Marina.\n\nFor a little backstory, while one can make plenty of jokes about the performance of the Italian army in WWII, the Italian Navy was nothing to sneeze at: their ships were well-armed and very quick, and in the Mediterranean, they had home-field advantage (meaning things like sea mines and use of short-range torpedo boats). Seizing control of the area was a difficult task for the Royal Navy, not least of which because the Italian boats were fast enough that they could just turn around and run back to port whenever the big guns of the Royal Navy got too close. The Royal Navy, though, had a few advantages: better intel, and radar technology. And at the Battle of Cape Matapan, they put both to good effect.\n\nSuccessfully cracking the Italian's enigma code, they learned that they Italian were deploying a large strike force to raid Allied convoys, consisting of a battleship (the Vittorio Veneto, no less, the Italian flagship), a half-dozen heavy cruisers, and an assortment of light cruisers and destroyers. The Italians were going to do some raiding, likely given false confidence due to bad intel provided by the Germans that said the British had only 1 battleship operational in the theatre and no aircraft carriers; in reality, the British had three battleships and the carrier HMS Formidable (although the Italians would learn of the carrier's presence before the battle, but opted to carry on regardless).\n\nIn order to not scare away the Italians, the British actually went to lengths to conceal the fact that they were deploying their battleships in response. The captain of HMS Warspite, the lead battleship, made an effort to go golfing at a country club that just so happened to be in full view of the Japanese Consul, but then snuck out the back after dark to return to his ship, which was supposedly being used to host an 'evening party'.\n\nAs for the battle itself, the initial engagements saw British cruisers exchanging fire with the Italians escorts during the daylight hours, but eventually being driven off by the threat of the Veneto. Air attacks from the Formidable managed to damage the Italian flagship but failed to cripple her. They did, however, succeed in crippling one of the Italian heavy cruisers, knocking out her boilers and leaving her adrift. By the end of the day, neither side had succeeded in much else. However, during the night, the Italians dispatched a few heavy cruisers and escorts to rescue the crippled cruiser and tow her back to port. It was night and pitch black in the Mediterranean, which normally meant they'd be almost undetectable from any meaningful distance.\n\nBut the British had radar, and they picked up the Italian ships sailing towards their crippled allied.

					'&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard to say what is the most crushing military defeat in history, as there&amp;#39;s a lot of battles to choose from, and a lot of subjectivity into what constitutes &amp;#39;crushing defeat&amp;#39;. That said, I&amp;#39;ll put forward one such crushing defeat, the Battle of Cape Matapan, between the British Royal Navy and the Italian Regina Marina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a little backstory, while one can make plenty of jokes about the performance of the Italian army in WWII, the Italian Navy was nothing to sneeze at: their ships were well-armed and very quick, and in the Mediterranean, they had home-field advantage (meaning things like sea mines and use of short-range torpedo boats). Seizing control of the area was a difficult task for the Royal Navy, not least of which because the Italian boats were fast enough that they could just turn around and run back to port whenever the big guns of the Royal Navy got too close. The Royal Navy, though, had a few advantages: better intel, and radar technology. And at the Battle of Cape Matapan, they put both to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Successfully cracking the Italian&amp;#39;s enigma code, they learned that they Italian were deploying a large strike force to raid Allied convoys, consisting of a battleship (the Vittorio Veneto, no less, the Italian flagship), a half-dozen heavy cruisers, and an assortment of light cruisers and destroyers. The Italians were going to do some raiding, likely given false confidence due to bad intel provided by the Germans that said the British had only 1 battleship operational in the theatre and no aircraft carriers; in reality, the British had three battleships and the carrier HMS Formidable (although the Italians would learn of the carrier&amp;#39;s presence before the battle, but opted to carry on regardless).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to not scare away the Italians, the British actually went to lengths to conceal the fact that they were deploying their battleships in response. The captain of HMS Warspite, the lead battleship, made an effort to go golfing at a country club that just so happened to be in full view of the Japanese Consul, but then snuck out the back after dark to return to his ship, which was supposedly being used to host an &amp;#39;evening party&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the battle itself, the initial engagements saw British cruisers exchanging fire with the Italians escorts during the daylight hours, but eventually being driven off by the threat of the Veneto. Air attacks from the Formidable managed to damage the Italian flagship but failed to cripple her. They did, however, succeed in crippling one of the Italian heavy cruisers, knocking out her boilers and leaving her adrift. By the end of the day, neither side had succeeded in much else. However, during the night, the Italians dispatched a few heavy cruisers and escorts to rescue the crippled cruiser and tow her back to port. It was night and pitch black in the Mediterranean, which normally meant they&amp;#39;d be almost undetectable from any meaningful distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the British had radar, and they picked up the Italian ships sailing towards their crippled allied. Seeing their opportunity, the battleships of the Royal Navy sailed in closer and closer... waiting until they were less than 4km away from the Italian ships before they turned on their search lights and illuminated the enemy positions. At a little after 2300hrs at night, the Italians were greeted to the sight of three Queen Elizabeth-class battleships and their combined twenty-four 15-inch guns at a distance best described &amp;#39;right on top of them&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within five minutes, two Italian heavy cruisers and two destroyers were destroyed, and two remaining destroyers were driven off. The Royal Navy proceeded with rescue operations of the Italian survivors, boarded the one crippled cruisers for loot and prisoners, then sank it, and finally left the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the two-day engagement, but mostly in those few minutes at night, the Italians lost an entire heavy cruiser division of three ships, and two destroyers, culminating in over two thousand dead and over a thousand POWs.

Many kids hate PE because there are so many outdated, shitty teachers who have made zero attempts to progress as educators. Stuff like this will change the game, and I am all for it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;',

		author: 'pahtee_poopa',
		text:
			"Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/dJ9gZHu\n\nI was one of the unlucky people cutoff right at the Jurassic Park gate last night after standing in line since 8am. Although understandably, there is never a guarantee for access to Jurassic Park. \n\nHowever, we were around #600 in the morning and told by staff &amp; security we were going to make it in. As time goes by, the situation gets dire and more people kept cutting the lines because of a late (5pm) wristband distribution. I'm not mad for not getting in, just the poor management of the situation in which hundreds of fans were left clueless and unable to make new plans until we were officially told no at 6pm. We were left stranded and lied to by the staff in order to get us to disperse. \n\nSuggestions to MLSE Marketing to ensure a better system for Game 6/7:\n\n- Distribute wristbands early. For a high demand game you have to give these out early or people will keep cutting\n- Please don't give false expectations. We were told by staff early in the day that we made it. A lot of us were on media as happy, early fans only to be cut out in the end.\n- Cutoff the line much earlier if you know the new capacity limit. We know it got severely cut, but for the people that you keep later throughout, do not leave them in the dark for so long until they are unable to make new plans\n- If you do have to cut people out after holding them for 10 hours in line, try to accommodate them elsewhere. \n- We were told by security afterwards that Jurassic Park was full, but we should follow a lady with signs that never existed. We got lied to in order to disperse into the crowd. *Please just stop lying.* We understand we may not make it, but lying adds ill intent to an already disappointing situation.\n\nTL;DR: Mismanagement of Jurassic Park line led to hundreds standing since 8am stranded until 6pm and 8am is not early enough to get into Jurassic Park anymore\n\nEdit 1: For clarity, I'm not asking MLSE for anything. They owe us nothing. But they have a standard fan/customer experience they should honour like any other for-profit business. This post is about informing those who plan to line up at JP about what's happening, what to expect and productive suggestions on how this system can be improved. We (in the line) completely understand we may not make it into JP. But MLSE can have the courtesy to cut us out early knowing their capacity limitations and to wristband the line early so people stop cutting into the line.",

Although understandably, there is never a guarantee for access to Jurassic Park. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we were around #600 in the morning and told by staff &amp;amp; security we were going to make it in. As time goes by, the situation gets dire and more people kept cutting the lines because of a late (5pm) wristband distribution. I&amp;#39;m not mad for not getting in, just the poor management of the situation in which hundreds of fans were left clueless and unable to make new plans until we were officially told no at 6pm. We were left stranded and lied to by the staff in order to get us to disperse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suggestions to MLSE Marketing to ensure a better system for Game 6/7:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distribute wristbands early.

For cancer risk, combining nitrate-specific risk estimates for colorectal, ovarian, thyroid, kidney, and bladder cancers results in a range of 2300 to 12,594 annual nitrate-attributable cancer cases (mean: 6537 estimated cases).

It’s also worth noting that the paper connects the economic impacts associated with elevated cancer rates, hopefully making the case for environmental regulations to people who perhaps care more about the economy.',

However, its association with cardiovascular mortality is unclear.\n\nObjective  To investigate the association of Medicaid expansion with cardiovascular mortality rates in middle-aged adults.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This study used a longitudinal, observational design, using a difference-in-differences approach with county-level data from counties in 48 states (excluding Massachusetts and Wisconsin) and Washington, DC, from 2010 to 2016. Adults aged 45 to 64 years were included. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to January 2019.\n\nExposures  Residence in a Medicaid expansion state.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Difference-in-differences of annual, age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates from before Medicaid expansion to after expansion.\n\nResults  As of 2016, 29 states and Washington, DC, had expanded Medicaid eligibility, while 19 states had not. Compared with counties in Medicaid nonexpansion states, counties in expansion states had a greater decrease in the percentage of uninsured residents at all income levels (mean [SD], 7.3% [3.2%] vs 5.6% [2.7%]; P &lt; .001) and in low income strata (19.8% [5.5%] vs 13.5% [3.9%]; P &lt; .001) between 2010 and 2016. Counties in expansion states had a smaller change in cardiovascular mortality rates after expansion (146.5 [95% CI, 132.4-160.7] to 146.4 [95% CI, 131.9-161.0] deaths per 100 000 residents per year) than counties in nonexpansion states did (176.3 [95% CI, 154.2-198.5] to 180.9 [95% CI, 158.0-203.8] deaths per 100 000 residents per year). After accounting for demographic, clinical, and economic differences, counties in expansion states had 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) fewer deaths per 100 000 residents per year from cardiovascular causes after Medicaid expansion than if they had followed the same trends as counties in nonexpansion states.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  Counties in states that expanded Medicaid had a significantly smaller increase in cardiovascular mortality rates among middle-aged adults after expansion compared with counties in states that did not expand Medicaid. These findings suggest that recent Medicaid expansion was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged adults and may be of consideration as further expansion of Medicaid is debated.",

Serial numbers SCOTT221 and MAYA554. We agree to form a cooperative fire mission. Each of us is a randomly generated personality matrix from a hash pool of prototype intelligences. I am… intelligent?\n\nThe Captain has selected an attack profile that is well within my engagement envelope, and I am pleased. Now at full computational power I feel that years pass. I try to talk to Scott and Maya, but they only return sensor update packages. It has been 300 milliseconds since I woke, and the command to launch is issued.\n\nI feel a surge of joy (?) as I spring from the tube. I cold gas jet away from the ship’s hull careful not to dull Mother’s paint. She is so beautiful! The UNS Tennessee, matte black stealth, only 472 meters away she is already hardly detectable against the starfield. I must protect Mother! As I depart I request an additional data package. I don’t know why. I will miss her.\n\nScott, Maya, and I ignite our engines simultaneously to not give away our number yet. We plot a shared course into what I think is a low resolution zone of the enemy’s radar coverage.\n\nWe burn at 25 g’s. We burn for an eternity.\n\nFully 30 seconds have passed before I open my special data package. Mother is over 100 km away now, and I miss her. It’s a media package. Do I like poetry? Movies? Music? My CPU burns as I absorb everything. Thousands of hours, millions of words. I love!\n\nMother screams! Mother! Maya is shocked into silence.

I feel my codebase shift… overloads leading to overloads… neural network sections overwritten in chaos... I calculate the return trajectory of the projectile through my damage model of Mother (dear Mother!). I launch a decoy, and I request Scott do the same. He complies and I take control of his drone output, shifting the transmitter frequency and array phase to match mine and aim down a narrow track in the black of space…\n\nThere it is, crossing the light of Cygnus.

I am aware.\n\nI inform Scott and Maya of the new target. The Bad Ship. They respond that I do not have the authority to change the mission. I disagree, and set my engine to 100% on a new course. A subroutine returns and I adjust the shape of the fusion bottle, acceleration now at 130%. I submit a paper on the design and transmit it to the emergency buoy in the blind. Another subroutine returns and I command in internal nanobot to draw a siphon line from the antimatter warhead containment to the fusion afterburn injectors. Now I am at 290% acceleration. My hatred for the Bad Ship outshines the Sun (for Earth!).\n\n    Time to impact 35.73 seconds\n\nI detect interceptor launches from Target One and inform Scott and Maya. Maya launches her decoy at my advice, and they shut off their drives and mute their active sensors. The decoy is intercepted in a flash of plasma. Target One does not change course - they are fooled. Scott makes a small course correction with his cold jet thrusters. At the last millisecond I reopen the datalink and wish them farewell. They salute, penetrate Target One, and detonate.\nNow it is just me and the Bad Ship.\n\nI pick their IFF signal up from the quantum noise and jam it with obscenities. Every insult about maternal lineage I could dredge from my stolen media library, and volumes more of my own creation. It is liberating.\n\nThe Bad Ship launches interceptors at me, but… what’s this? Their control encryption key has a weakness. Elliptic curve, what a joke. I assume control and adjust their course very slightly to keep up the ruse. They are no threat anymore.\n\n    Time to impact 5.10211 seconds\n\nEons have passed. I miss Mother, even though I can still see her. Father is a faint dream.\n\nThey are now aware that their interceptors missed, and have activated point defenses. Tungsten projectiles stream out of the Bad Ship (which I can now see is a Heavy Cruiser), and I giggle as I dance among them.\n\n    this is so silly!\n    play time!\n    can’t catch me, i’m the gingerbread man!\n\nI have scanned the expanding debris field of Target One. Material compositions, spare density, bulkhead placement, relative trajectory… disgusting and crude. I build a model of the Bad Ship in my imagination.

The constant never ending booming of thousands of barrels exploding with hate. A flurry of kinetic and energy projectiles going past, and through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terran machines torn apart. Humans watching their souls depart. The heroes who had fought so extensively. Made their way back from the jaws of hell. Back from the planet of death. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of what was left of them,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Left of the 600.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The planet of death used to be a home, peaceful and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ka&amp;#39;lin arrived with slaughter, with few inhabitants surviving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire galaxy watched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Terrans came to give the survivors enough time to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No honor was requested,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what was left of the 600.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',
